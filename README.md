Project Title:  Beyond Cricket
Main Problem: 
        To analyze Batsman performance and create predictive models using historical data to aid in decision-making for fantasy cricket       
        enthusiasts.
Objective: 
      Data and Initial Findings: 
        For this Analysis, data is collected from the cricinfo website, which provided the variables impacting the performance of the player.            Some of them are Innings played, Runs scored, Balls Faced and 6s and 4s hit. Preliminary assessments indicate a strong positive       
        relationship between the balls faced and runs scored per game. 
        
Approach:
         In our endeavour to enhance decision-making in fantasy cricket, we harnessed machine learning methodologies, employing Linear     
         Regression to discern the optimal picks based on opposition and ground dynamics. Additionally, leveraging the K-means Algorithm, we 
         clustered batsmen data into four distinct groups, a determination made through the insightful Elbow Method. This clustering aided in 
         identifying nuanced player categories, enhancing our ability to recommend diverse strategies.
         
        Furthermore, our exploration delved into the intricate relationships between key performance indicators like batsmen runs and innings            played. This comprehensive analysis involved constructing a predictive model trained on fundamental attributes such as innings, run-             scored, balls-faced, opposition, and ground conditions. Rigorous validation processes and meticulous adjustments fortified the         
        reliability of our forecasts, aligning with our primary objective of delivering dependable predictions.

Ensuring transparency and trust in our analyses,. Our paramount aim remains the generation of robust and reliable predictions, empowering fantasy cricket enthusiasts with actionable insights for strategic decision-making.
This multifaceted approach, augmented by advanced methodologies and rigorous validation, underpins our commitment to delivering trustworthy and insightful predictions, fostering an environment of informed choices in the dynamic realm of fantasy cricket.
